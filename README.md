Fundable
---

Fundable  - A FireTV app for engaging with live content and supporting content creators such as musicians and streamers.

Built for the <a href="https://xrplimpact.devpost.com/" target="_blank">XRPL Hackathon 2022</a>

## Inspiration

Fundable aims to help aspiring entrepreneurs by allowing charitable lenders with tools to get resources to those that need them the most and maximize the impact of a loan by automatically relending funds once they are repaid. With crowd-sourced micro-loans, students can pay for tuition, women can start businesses, farmers are able to invest in equipment and families can afford needed emergency care. With all transactions taking place on the blockchain, lenders benefit from increased accountability and borrowers can establish credit.

Fundable solves this by:
1. Enabling users to provide pitch videos that can get displayed in public locations or as a mobile app.
2. Removing the middle man from donation scenarios - funds go directly to the wallet of the particular video's choosing.
3. Uses the low-cost XRP Ledger to facilitate micro payments (or normal payments) where previously gas fees would be cost prohibitive.

## What it does

This TV app enables the discovery of companies and individuals needing support.

Each business uploads its XRP cryptocurrency address (currently XRP, and nearly any cryptocurrency that enables wallet transfers for mobile could work in the future for payments as well).

Creates a netflix-style discovery experience where consumers can find interesting projects to donate to from the comfort of their living room or couch. From each company or project page, the user can scan a QR code which will take you directly to checkout to complete payment from their mobile device. No need to enter credentials on the television set; the television could be positioned in a public space and still enable secure payments using the QR code and their mobile wallet information.

### Technical
Combination of the Xpring SDK, XRP Testnet, and the XRPL specification (JSON RPC / Websocket).
